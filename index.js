  "Cyber security is like a safety shield for our computers and the internet. Imagine your computer as your house and cyber security as the lock on your front door. It keeps your house safe from thieves, right? Similarly, cyber security keeps your computer safe from bad people, known as hackers, who want to steal important information. This information could be your favorite gameâ€™s high score or your parents' bank details. Just like we use keys to unlock our house, we use passwords to unlock our computers or online accounts. But, just as you should not share your house keys with strangers, you should also not share your passwords. Sometimes, hackers can trick you into opening a harmful email or click on a dangerous link. This is why we should be careful about what we click on the internet. Cyber security uses special computer programs that act like super-strong locks and guards, always watching and protecting our information. So remember, cyber security is our friend that helps us use the internet safely and have lots of fun online without worrying about hackers.";
